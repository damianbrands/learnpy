# EXERCISE:
# Without touching the print statements, make all of them return True!
# Create your own three variables
# variable_1
# variable_2
# variable_3

# Write your own code in between the lines here:
# -----------------------------------


# -----------------------------------

# Print statements (DON'T TOUCH THEM, but do look at them otherwise you won't know how to solve them!):

print(f"Print 1 is: {True == int(variable_1)}")
print(f"Print 2 is: {type(variable_1) is str}")
print(f"Print 3 is: {5 < variable_2 < 10}")

# You can write more code down here! (Stay between the lines)
# -----------------------------------


# -----------------------------------

print(f"Print 4 is: {int(variable_1) * variable_2 == variable_3}")
print(f"Print 5 is: {type(variable_2) is int}")
print(f"Print 6 is: {variable_2 != variable_3}")
print(f"Print 7 is: {variable_3 > 20}")
