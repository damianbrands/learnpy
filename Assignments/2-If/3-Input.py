# Great Job! Now onto the real work. In this assignment you will be learning how to use user inputs. I will start off
# with an example. Then you will start creating functions yourself.

def examplefunction():
    # This line below demonstrates how you ask the user for a number using input and put this in the variable
    # 'userinput'.
    userinput = input("Enter a number: ")
    # This line below then proceeds to print the input the user just gave.
    print(userinput)

def firstassignment():
    # Program a line of code where you ask the user for a word using input, and put this in to a variable called 'word'
    # HINT: Base the line of code off of the first line of code in the examplefunction().

    # Now check if the value of the variable 'word' is equal to a certain word.
    # For example: Check if the input of the user equals the word 'goat'.
    if ():
        # If this condition is true, print the value of the variable.
        print()
