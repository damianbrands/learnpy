# Hello! In this chapter you will be learning about If-Else statements and Inputs.

# If statements:
# An If statement is a statement to check a condition, and execute something if the condition is true.

def firstassignment():
    # For this assignment you want to check if the number of variable B is greater than the number of variable A.
    a = 4
    b = 9

    # Add a condition between the parentheses after 'if'
    if ():
        print("B is greater than A")

    # Expected output: "B is greater than A"

def secondassignment():
    # For this assignment you need to check if variable B is the same as variable A.
    a = "Hello World!"
    b = "Hello World!"

    # Add a condition between the parentheses after 'if'
    if ():
        print("B and A are the same")

    # Expected output: "B and A are the same"

def thirdassignment():
    # Now we want to check if B is greater than A, but smaller than C
    a = 2
    b = 5
    c = 10

    # Add a condition between the parentheses after 'if'
    if ():
        print("B is greater than A, but smaller than C")

    # Expected output: "B is greater than A, but smaller than C"
